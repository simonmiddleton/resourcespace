# StaticSync Path to metadata mapping
# ------------------------
# It is possible to take path information and map selected parts of the path to metadata fields.
# For example, if you added a mapping for '/projects/' and specified that the second level should be 'extracted' means that 'ABC' would be extracted as metadata into the specified field if you added a file to '/projects/ABC/'
# Hence meaningful metadata can be specified by placing the resource files at suitable positions within the static
# folder hierarchy.
# Use the line below as an example. Repeat this for every mapping you wish to set up
#	$staticsync_mapfolders[]=array
#		(
#		"match"=>"/projects/",
#		"field"=>10,
#		"level"=>2
#		);
#
# You can also now enter "access" in "field" to set the access level for the resource. The value must match the name of the access level
# in the default local language. Note that custom access levels are not supported. For example, the mapping below would set anything in 
# the projects/restricted folder to have a "Restricted" access level.
#	$staticsync_mapfolders[]=array
#		(
#		"match"=>"/projects/restricted",
#		"field"=>"access",
#		"level"=>2
#		);
#
# You can enter "archive" in "field" to set the archive state for the resource. You must include "archive" to the array and its value must match either a default level or a custom archive level. The mapped folder level does not need to match the name of the archive level. Note that this will override $staticsync_defaultstate. For example, the mapping below would set anything in the restricted folder to have an "Archived" archive level.
#   $staticsync_mapfolders[]=array
#		(
#		"match"=>"/projects/restricted",
#		"field"=>"archive",
#		"level"=>2,

#
# ALTERNATIVE FILES

# If staticsync finds a folder in the same directory as a file with the same name as a file but with this suffix appended, then files in the folder will be treated as alternative files for the given file.
# For example a folder/file structure might look like:
# /staticsync_folder/myfile.jpg
# /staticsync_folder/myfile.jpg_alternatives/alternative1.jpg
# /staticsync_folder/myfile.jpg_alternatives/alternative2.jpg
# /staticsync_folder/myfile.jpg_alternatives/alternative3.jpg
# NOTE: Alternative file processing only works when $staticsync_ingest is set to 'true'.

# OPTION 2 - ADD FILES IN SAME FOLDER WITH DEFINED STRING SUFFIX
# Option to have alternative files located in same directory as primary files but identified by a defined string. As with staticsync_alternatives_suffix this only works when $staticsync_ingest is set to 'true'.
# Can instead use $staticsync_alt_suffix_array below 
#$staticsync_alternative_file_text="_alt_";

# OPTION 3 - ADD FILES IN SAME FOLDER WITH VARIOUS STRING SUFFIXES
# $staticsync_alt_suffixes / $staticsync_alt_suffix_array 
# These can be used instead of $staticsync_alternatives_suffix to 
# support mapping suffixes to the names used for the alternative files
/*
